# spectra-cluster-gui
GUI interface for the spectra-cluster-cli project

This project is currently only in planning phase.

# System requirements

The spectra-cluster-gui requires Java 8 and, as a Java application, runs on Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X.
The requirement for Java 8 is due to the fact that Java 7 (and previous versions) no longer receives public
security updates.
